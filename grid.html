        <p>Royal Enfield is an Indian motorcycle manufacturer, headquartered and manufactured in Chennai.[1] Royal Enfield is the oldest motorcycle manufacturer in continuous production.[2]

The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901 by The Enfield Cycle Company of Redditch, Worcestershire, England, the company was responsible for the design and original production of the Royal Enfield Bullet, the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.[3] Licensed from the original English Royal Enfield by Madras Motors, the company is now a subsidiary of Eicher Motors, an Indian automaker.[4] The company makes classic-looking motorcycles including the Royal Enfield Bullet, Classic 350, Royal Enfield Thunderbird, Meteor 350, Classic 500, Interceptor 650, Continental, Hunter 350 and many more. Royal Enfield also makes adventurous and offroading motorcycles like the Royal Enfield Himalayan. Their motorcycles are equipped with single-cylinder and twin-cylinder engines.[5]</p>

        <p>After India gained independence in 1947, the then government looked for a suitable motorcycle for the army patrolling the borders. In 1952 they chose the Royal Enfield Bullet, in 1954 ordering 800 units of the 350 cc model. In 1955, the Redditch company partnered with Madras Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras (now Chennai), including the factory tooling, sold to Enfield India.[6] By 1962, all components were made in India. Enfield India used the 1960 engine (with metric bearing sizes); Royal Enfield still makes essentially the same bike in 350 cc and 500 cc models, and now different models for other market segments.[7]</p>

    <div class="para3">
        <p>In the year 1990, Royal Enfield collaborated with the Eicher Group, an automotive company in India, and merged with it in 1994.[8] Apart from bikes, Eicher Group is involved in the production and sales of commercial vehicles and automotive gears. Although Royal Enfield experienced difficulties in the 1990s, and ceased motorcycle production at their Jaipur factory in 2002,[9] by 2013 the company opened a new primary factory in the Chennai suburb of Oragadam on the strength of increased demand for its motorcycles. This was followed in 2017 by the inauguration of another new factory of a similar size to the facility at Oragadam (capacity 600,000 vehicles per year) at Vallam Vadagal. The original factory at Tiruvottiyur became secondary, and continues to produce some limited-run motorcycle models.[10][11][12][13]</p>

    <div class="para4">
        <p>n November 2015, a flooding, produced by the heaviest rainfall in Chennai in over a century, caused Royal Enfield to cut production by 4,000 motorcycles, followed by a shutdown of the plants in Thiruvottiyur and Oragadam on 1 December, as well as the company offices in Chennai.[14] Production resumed at 50% capacity on 7 December and operations at both plants were back to normal on 14 December.[15]

Royal Enfield announced its first takeover of another company in May 2015 with the purchase of a UK motorcycle design and manufacturing firm, Harris Performance Products,[16][17] that had previously developed the chassis of the Royal Enfield Continental GT Cafe Racer.[18] Harris work with the UK-based part of Royal Enfield's development team, who are based at the UK Technology Centre at Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground in Leicestershire. The team was established in January 2015, and moved into their new, purpose-built facility in May 2017. By the end of 2019, the team numbered 155 and carries out the full spectrum of design and development activities, from concept generation and clay design to engineering design, prototyping and validation.

Royal Enfield currently sells motorcycles in more than 50 countries. Royal Enfield surpassed Harley-Davidson in global sales in 2015.[19][20]</p>
